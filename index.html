            Congressional Focus on the Implications of College Athlete Employment and Title IX Implications - Season 4 Episode 7
          </a>
        </h3><p>In this episode, we discuss how discredited ideas about college sport amateurism shaped the April 8, 2025 U.S. House Committee on the Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions hearing entitled The NLRB, Student-Athletes, and the Future of College Sports. We explore the implications of continuing to perpetuate the underlying assumptions and mythologies that have formed the basis for an exploitative system that harms college athletes economically, educationally, physically, and psychologically. Along the way, we get into the problematic way in which Title IX is used to preserve the status quo instead of challenging the power structure that suppresses the value of all college athletes.</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>In this episode, we go inside the athletic training room to examine more closely the impact of profit-motives on the decisions made regarding college athlete health and well-being and how athletes experience the training room environment. We will also be discussing the racial and gender dynamics that affect injured athletes, their perception of injury, and how injury affects their relationships with coaches, teammates, and sports medicine staff. Dr. Kaitlyn Pericak, author of Body Factory: Exploiting University Athletes’ Healthcare for Profit in the Training Room, shares her work based on her time observing the inner workings of athletic training rooms.</p>

            Gender Logics That Shape Women Athlete Experience in Sport - Season 4 Episode 5
          </a>
        </h3><p>Few would dispute the fact that sport as it is organized in the United States and many places around the world is a gendered environment. Structured around a gender binary, the predominant structure of sport is sex segregated. As much as laws like Title IX are generally thought to foster equal access to sport for men and women, the very act of separating places a spotlight on difference. For women athletes developing in such a system, what gender logics shape their sense of who they are and how do they co-construct these logics? In a fascinating autoethnography, Bowling Green State University sport management professor Meredith Flaherty, who is a former NCAA Division I women’s soccer player, professional soccer player and coach at the youth and college levels, reflects on her own experiences through the lens of gender, discourse, and agency. In this episode, we speak with Meredith about her journey as an athlete, coach, and scholar and the insights she has gained by putting her own athletic career under the microscope.</p>

They created The Pipeline Project, which is an expansive study of the state of women in intercollegiate athletic administration, documenting where progress has been made for women in athletic administration, points in the industry that call for greater attention and change, and how to advance women in athletics administration.</p>

            The Role College Athletics Plays in Enrollment at Small Private Institutions and Gender Equity Implications - Season 4 Episode 1
          </a>
        </h3><p>For those familiar with the history of college sport and higher education, athletics has played a key role in admission and enrollment efforts in colleges and universities since the late 1800s to the present. In the very early days when land grant institutions like LSU and private colleges like Stanford or Notre Dame were getting established, men’s sports programs became vehicles to attract new applicants and to create name brand recognition. In describing the relationship of athletics to a college campus, Scott Barnes, then athletic director at Utah State University in 2009 offered the metaphor that “Athletics are the front porch of the university. It’s not the most important room in the house, but it is the most visible”. For small private institutions in the 21st century, athletics has increasingly become a critical consideration in enrollment planning. From a strategic perspective, some schools have added men’s sports to respond to declining interest from male applicants. Other schools have added both men’s and women’s teams as part of what is a sports enrollment strategy to build enrollment. And still others gambled on sports enrollment as a survival strategy and lost. To help us gain a better understanding of how “sports enrollment” fits within a larger enrollment strategy for small private colleges, we are joined today by Dr. Steve Dittmore. Steve is dean of the College of Education and Human Services with the University of North Florida.</p>

Coach Carlson has been the head coach of women’s rugby at Quinnipiac since its inception in 2011, building the program from the ground up and creating a Division I women’s rugby program that in short order won three back to back NIRA championships and has won 70% of its games in the last 13 years.</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>Within athletic departments that operate under the umbrella of the NCAA, reports of sexual violence on the part of athletes; coaches; administrators; and donors raise a host of questions about factors that may contribute to cultures of violence and questions regarding Title IX compliance and accountability. To help us sort through some of this, I am pleased to welcome to the show Molly Harry, an assistant professor of sports management with the University of Arkansas and Katrina (Trina) Garry, Deputy Title IX Coordinator with the University of San Francisco. Our conversation today is on a project they did focusing on Challenges and Best Practices for Sexual Violence Prevention and Education in Division I Athletics Departments published in the Journal of Issues in Intercollegiate Athletics.</p>

After an investigative report published in USA Today revealed that FSU was not providing equitable opportunities for women athletes under Title IX, Sophia led an effort assisted by Lori and her colleague, Arthur Bryant, to elevate women’s lacrosse to varsity status. In October of 2023, FSU announced that a varsity women’s lacrosse program was expected to debut in the spring of 2026 and that they had a commitment to creating a gender equity process to ensure that the interests of women athletes at FSU are protected.</p>

            College Athletes Compensation Issues: The Current Status of In re: College Athlete NIL Litigation - Season 2 Episode 3
          </a>
        </h3><p>In a case currently pending in the US District Court in Northern California before Judge Claudia Wilkens, multiple college athletes have challenged the NCAA and the Power Five Conferences for retroactive compensation they were denied as a result of the NCAA’s restrictive compensation rules and share of revenue produced from broadcast rights. This case is being watched closely because of what a favorable ruling would mean for college athletes and how this might affect the business of college sport moving forward. To help us break down this case and talk through these arguments that are being presented on both sides, today we have Matt Netti, an associate with Nixon Peabody who focuses on employment counseling, representing employers in litigation and labor negotiations, and a wide variety of general labor and employment matters.</p>

To help us talk through these things today and to understand the dynamics around the access college athletes have to information about their rights relative to pregnancy and parenting under Title IX and NCAA bylaws as well as policy, we have two special guests, Dr. David McArdle and Dr. Sylvia de Mars.</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>For those who follow college sports, a woman playing on a man’s team is not completely unusual but not something you hear about every day either. On March 17, 2023, first year walk-on Olivia Pichardo became the first woman to play in an NCAA Division I baseball game. Interestingly enough, Title IX has something called the contact sports exemption that a school can invoke to keep a woman from playing on some men’s teams, such as baseball. In this episode, we learn more about the contact sports exemption, how Title IX is on a collision course with the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment when it comes to athletes competing on mixed sex teams, and whether the contact sports exemption should still exist in the 21st century.</p>

            An Introduction and Welcome to Talking Title IX and College Sports - Season 1 Episode 0
          </a>
        </h3><p>This spring, students in my Title IX and College Sports class have been studying about Title IX and its application to athletics in the 50th year since Title IX was passed in 1972.  Together we’ve learned about the wonder of Title IX as a comprehensive piece of federal legislation that has, over the years, singularly or in tandem with other equity laws, helped unlock access to educational and athletic opportunities, paving the way for inroads into academic majors and jobs that were once thought of as the exclusive domains of either men or women.  Even as we learn about Title IX’s impact on the ability of students to gain equal access to educational opportunity regardless of gender, the facts about Title IX have also left so many questions unanswered, most specifically why so few Americans in general, and people in college sports in particular - think athletes, coaches, and athletics administrators - know very little about what Title IX is and what it actually requires.</p>
