            Addressing Title IX Shortfalls: The Case of Women&#39;s Lacrosse at Florida State - Season 2 Episode 5
          </a>
        </h3><p>In this episode, we talk with woman athlete activist and Florida State University (FSU) women’s lacrosse player Sophia Villalonga and attorney Lori Bullock of Bailey Glasser. After an investigative report published in USA Today revealed that FSU was not providing equitable opportunities for women athletes under Title IX, Sophia led an effort assisted by Lori and her colleague, Arthur Bryant, to elevate women’s lacrosse to varsity status. In October of 2023, FSU announced that a varsity women’s lacrosse program was expected to debut in the spring of 2026 and that they had a commitment to creating a gender equity process to ensure that the interests of women athletes at FSU are protected.</p>

            College Athletes Compensation Issues: The Current Status of In re: College Athlete NIL Litigation - Season 2 Episode 3
          </a>
        </h3><p>In a case currently pending in the US District Court in Northern California before Judge Claudia Wilkens, multiple college athletes have challenged the NCAA and the Power Five Conferences for retroactive compensation they were denied as a result of the NCAA’s restrictive compensation rules and share of revenue produced from broadcast rights. This case is being watched closely because of what a favorable ruling would mean for college athletes and how this might affect the business of college sport moving forward. To help us break down this case and talk through these arguments that are being presented on both sides, today we have Matt Netti, an associate with Nixon Peabody who focuses on employment counseling, representing employers in litigation and labor negotiations, and a wide variety of general labor and employment matters.</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>In this episode, we focus on an often under-reported but incredibly important part of the lives of college athletes, that being the group of women athletes who are expectant mothers and women and men athletes who are parents. To help us talk through these things today and to understand the dynamics around the access college athletes have to information about their rights relative to pregnancy and parenting under Title IX and NCAA bylaws as well as policy, we have two special guests, Dr. David McArdle and Dr. Sylvia de Mars.</p>

        </h3><p>In this episode we examined issues related to ongoing conversations regarding transgender athlete experience in sport, efforts to make sport a more inclusive space for transgender athletes, and increasing efforts on the part of state entities to regulate and control how, when, and under what circumstances transgender athletes compete in sport.</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>In this episode we examined issues related to the reproductive rights of women athletes beginning with a brief historical perspective on the tensions around perceived risks and threats that sports participation posed for women in the late 19th and 20th centuries and issues women athletes face in the 21st century including women athletes rights under Title IX in terms of pregnancy and parenting; problematic issues associated with tracking the menstrual cycles of women athletes; and how access to bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom impact women athletes and women’s lives in general.</p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>In this episode, we examined the case of Noriana Radwan, a former women’s soccer player at the University of Connecticut who lost her athletic scholarship after she made an obscene gesture that was caught on camera.

          </a>
        </h3><p>For those who follow college sports, a woman playing on a man’s team is not completely unusual but not something you hear about every day either. On March 17, 2023, first year walk-on Olivia Pichardo became the first woman to play in an NCAA Division I baseball game. Interestingly enough, Title IX has something called the contact sports exemption that a school can invoke to keep a woman from playing on some men’s teams, such as baseball. In this episode, we learn more about the contact sports exemption, how Title IX is on a collision course with the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment when it comes to athletes competing on mixed sex teams, and whether the contact sports exemption should still exist in the 21st century.</p>

They have both played critically important roles in shaping women’s sport nationally and internationally for over 50 years.</p>

            An Introduction and Welcome to Talking Title IX and College Sports - Season 1 Episode 0
          </a>
        </h3><p>This spring, students in my Title IX and College Sports class have been studying about Title IX and its application to athletics in the 50th year since Title IX was passed in 1972.  Together we’ve learned about the wonder of Title IX as a comprehensive piece of federal legislation that has, over the years, singularly or in tandem with other equity laws, helped unlock access to educational and athletic opportunities, paving the way for inroads into academic majors and jobs that were once thought of as the exclusive domains of either men or women.  Even as we learn about Title IX’s impact on the ability of students to gain equal access to educational opportunity regardless of gender, the facts about Title IX have also left so many questions unanswered, most specifically why so few Americans in general, and people in college sports in particular - think athletes, coaches, and athletics administrators - know very little about what Title IX is and what it actually requires.</p>
