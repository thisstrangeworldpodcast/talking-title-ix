This case raises the basic question about whether women athletes are subjected to different standards in terms of their conduct and do they suffer greater penalties as a result.</p>

<p>Guests: Plaintiff’s attorneys Greg Tarone J.D. (extensive experience in sports law and athlete representation; he has been an agent and manager for LPGA, NBA, and Olympic athletes); Jonathan Klein, J.D., partner, Parlatore Law Group, Bridgeport Connecticut</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>For those who follow college sports, a woman playing on a man’s team is not completely unusual but not something you hear about every day either. On March 17, 2023, first year walk-on Olivia Pichardo became the first woman to play in an NCAA Division I baseball game. Interestingly enough, Title IX has something called the contact sports exemption that a school can invoke to keep a woman from playing on some men’s teams, such as baseball. In this episode, we learn more about the contact sports exemption, how Title IX is on a collision course with the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment when it comes to athletes competing on mixed sex teams, and whether the contact sports exemption should still exist in the 21st century.</p>

<p>Co-Hosts: Jeremy Goldstein (SPME ‘23); Max Adams (SPME ‘23); Isaiah Couzer (Ex ‘25); Dr. Ellen J. Staurowsky</p>

<p>Guest: Dr. Sarah Fields (University of Colorado at Denver and author of Female Gladiators: Gender, Law, and Contact Sport in America)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This spring, students in my Title IX and College Sports class have been studying about Title IX and its application to athletics in the 50th year since Title IX was passed in 1972.  Together we’ve learned about the wonder of Title IX as a comprehensive piece of federal legislation that has, over the years, singularly or in tandem with other equity laws, helped unlock access to educational and athletic opportunities, paving the way for inroads into academic majors and jobs that were once thought of as the exclusive domains of either men or women.  Even as we learn about Title IX’s impact on the ability of students to gain equal access to educational opportunity regardless of gender, the facts about Title IX have also left so many questions unanswered, most specifically why so few Americans in general, and people in college sports in particular - think athletes, coaches, and athletics administrators - know very little about what Title IX is and what it actually requires.</p>
